Cutting the Electric Bill for Internet-Scale Systems
ABSTRACT
Energy expenses are becoming an increasingly important
fraction of data center operating costs. At the same time,
the energy expense per unit of computation can vary significantly
between two different locations. In this paper,
we characterize the variation due to fluctuating electricity
prices and argue that existing distributed systems should be
able to exploit this variation for significant economic gains.
Electricity prices exhibit both temporal and geographic variation,
due to regional demand differences, transmission inef-
ficiencies, and generation diversity. Starting with historical
electricity prices, for twenty nine locations in the US, and
network traffic data collected on Akamai’s CDN, we use simulation
to quantify the possible economic gains for a realistic
workload. Our results imply that existing systems may be
able to save millions of dollars a year in electricity costs, by
being cognizant of locational computation cost differences.

1. INTRODUCTION
With the rise of “Internet-scale” systems and “cloud computing”
services, there is an increasing trend toward massive,
geographically distributed systems. The largest of these are
made up of hundreds of thousands of servers and several data
centers. A large data center may require many megawatts
of electricity [1], enough to power thousands of homes.
Millions of dollars must be spent annually on the electricity
needed to power one such system. Furthermore, these
already large systems are increasing in size at a rapid clip,
outpacing data center energy efficiency gains [2], and electricity
prices are expected to rise.

These are conservative estimates, meant to be lower
bounds. See §2.1 for derivation details. For scale, we
have included the actual 2007 consumption and utility
bill for the MIT campus, including dormitories and labs.
Organizations such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Yahoo!,
and many other operators of large networked systems
cannot ignore their energy costs. A back-of-the-envelope calculation
for Google suggests it consumes more than $38M
worth of electricity annually (figure 1). A modest 3% reduction
would therefore exceed a million dollars every year. We
project that even a smaller system like Akamai’s1
consumes
an estimated $10M worth of electricity annually2
